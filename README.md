# handwritten-text-cnn
This project is an image processing project/CNN that takes the image of a handwritten sentence, and shows an image of segmented/identified letters, as well a terminal output of the sentence strings

It currently has functionlity for a streamlit gui. This allows the user to upload a file, the gui will run the code and return the identified sentance automatically 
--- To run this just enter streamlit run gui.py.

This is the first version.  It's pretty limited in how many different types of handwriting it can recognize.  The next step is to improve the segmnetion algorithm.

The CNN the is used for the character identification has an accuracy rate of about 93.5%
