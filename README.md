## **Introduction**
The **Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) System** is a project developed to recognize and interpret handwritten sentences. This system leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the EMNIST Letters dataset to accurately identify individual handwritten characters. The project encompasses the creation and training of the CNN model, followed by image processing techniques to segment and detect characters within handwritten sentences.

## **Features**
- **CNN Model**: A robust Convolutional Neural Network tailored for character recognition.
- **Image Processing Pipeline**: Efficient segmentation of handwritten sentences into individual characters.
- **Space Detection**: Dynamic identification of spaces between words to reconstruct accurate sentences.
- **User Interface**: (If implemented) A Streamlit GUI for uploading and processing custom handwritten images.
